  A survey of discovery requirements for the Rubin Science Platform with
  proposed implementations.

# Abstract, if available
abstract: >
 The Rubin Science Platform is composed of a large number of separate
 services, some following external standards such as IVOA and some providing
 internal protocols. The services available and the data behind them will vary
 by site and need to be discoverable by users. This tech note lists known
 discovery needs for both services and schemas and proposes an implementation
 plan for meeting those needs.
